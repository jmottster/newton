# Newton's Laws

*A simulator of Newton's laws of physiscs, using space scale objects*

This is a small project just for me to learn and experiment. In spite of a life long interest in physics, I've never brought it to my programming skills. I am not a physicist though, so don't hold this to that standard! Feedback and/or help building this out is always welcome.
