    A Protocol class used to represent an object that draws a blob, with a distinction of the center blob

    Attributes
    ----------
    radius : float
        the size of the blob, by radius value
    color : tuple
        a three value tuple for RGB color value of blob
    universe: BlobUniverse
        The universe instance the blobs will be drawn on

    Methods
    -------

    resize(radius: float) -> None
        Sets a new radius for this blob

    update_center_blob(x: float, y: float, z: float) -> None
        Update the x,y,z of the center blob (for lighting effects, etc.,
        all blobs are informed where the center blob is)

    draw(pos: Tuple[float] = None, lighting: bool = True) -> None
        Draws this blob to the universe surface, with the given position (or uses position already set),
        send (pos,False) to turn off lighting effects

    draw_as_center_blob(pos: Tuple[float] = None, lighting: bool = True) -> None
        Draw the blob to the universe surface as the center blob (special glowing effect, no light/shade effect)
        send (pos,False) to turn off glowing effect
